"""The HTTP surface: every route, the API-key gate, and the paths that degrade.

The API is what makes this more than a screen, so these tests pin the contract another
system would integrate against. Four properties matter more than any individual route:

**The probes and the ward are different tiers.** ``/health``, ``/ready`` and ``/metrics``
answer without a key so an orchestrator can scrape them; every ``/api/v1`` route sits
behind ``X-API-Key`` the moment one is configured. That split is asserted structurally as
well as by request, so a router added to the wrong list fails a test instead of quietly
publishing the ward.

**Readiness is tolerant.** No trained model and no database are both supported
configurations and must not make the service unready - only a dead engine is fatal.

**Ticking is pull-based.** The ward advances at most once per ``tick_seconds`` unless
``force`` is set, so the API is exactly as live as the traffic it receives, and a tick that
raises serves the previous snapshot rather than a 500.

**Scoring is stateless.** ``/risk/score`` touches no ward state and is a complete answer on
NEWS2 alone, which is what lets another system integrate without adopting the simulator.
