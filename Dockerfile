# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7

# One image, three roles. `docker compose` picks the role with a command:
#
#   icu-monitor serve       -> the FastAPI service          (the image's default)
#   streamlit run app.py    -> the dashboard
#   icu-monitor etl/train   -> the one-shot data + model bootstrap
#
# Building the same layers for all three is what keeps "the API and the dashboard are the
# same tick" true in deployment as well as in the source: there is one install, so there is
# one NEWS2 implementation, one fusion, one model registry.
#
# The vision extra is NOT installed by default. `ultralytics` pulls in Torch - roughly
# 800 MB - and the detector degrades to a pure-NumPy backend that runs anywhere, so the
# default image stays small and still shows a live camera panel. To build with YOLO:
#
#   docker build --build-arg EXTRAS='[vision]' -t icu-monitor:vision .
